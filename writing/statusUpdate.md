Exploring Trends in Both Economic Growth & Public Health Data

**Subject:**
--
The subject of this project is analyzing the public health and economic data of over 200 countries from within a data set. In doing so, the goal of this project is to produce meaningful relationships between certain data elements to provide an insightful look into common trends among countries.

**Questions to Answer:**
---
```
  1. Is there a correlation between GDP per capita and infant mortality rate?
  2. Is there a correlation between energy consumption and natural gas production in this data set?
  3. Do countries with more extensive railways have less highways?
  4. Does a higher fertility rate correlate with a higher AIDS prevalence rate among adults? If so, how many countries are affected by this in the data set?
  5. Do the countries with the highest GDP have less debt (proportionally) than those with the lowest?
```
These questions are going to be discussed in depth in the report and the report will contain all of the queries that are necessary to answer them.

**Steps Taken:**
--
So far, I have collected my data and developed a plan to organize it and send it to a MongoDB database in order for easy processing and storage.

**Steps to Take:**
--
- Develop queries to respond to my research questions
- Develop a type of builder file using PyMongo to input data from CSV
- Come up with a plan of how to best implement PyMongo into my project
